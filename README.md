AFEM is a "fit-for-purpose" engineering development toolkit designed to support
the use of high-order structural analysis during the early phases of aircraft
conceptual design. As a development toolkit, it provides the engineer with a
flexible, modular, and extensible library of components and tools to rapidly
build a useful structural model. It is **not** an end-user GUI application, but
rather a library enabling engineers to rapidly build their own application
specific tools and processes, encoding their own design rules and best
practices along the way.

Although AFEM targets airframe design and analysis applications, really only
the ``afem.structure`` and ``afem.oml`` packages directly support that cause.
All the other packages provide a more general and "Pythonic" set of entities
and tools that could potentially be used to develop applications in other
disciplines and/or domains.

## Technology Stack
The AFEM core technology stack includes:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/): The Python programming language enables
  rapid development and integration with other systems.

* [OpenCASCADE](https://www.opencascade.com): This mature library provides
  advanced geometric modeling and CAD functionality and is under active
  development.
  
* [pythonocc-core](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core): This open source
  project provides Python bindings to the OpenCASCADE and is actively 
  maintained.

# Installation
AFEM is currently only supported for Windows 64-bit Python 3.5 and 3.6.
Cross-platform support is dependent upon prerequisites such as pythonocc-core.
[Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or
[Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) is recommended for installation
and regular use since many of the prerequisites are available via the Anaconda
Cloud.

It is recommended that a designated environment be created and used for AFEM.
An example of creating this environment for Anaconda Python within an Anaconda
command prompt is:

    conda env create -f ./docs/environment.yml

This will create an environment named "afem" with Python 3.5. Make sure this
environment is active when using AFEM. For Anaconda Python, activating this
environment may look like:

    activate afem

within an Anaconda command prompt.
 

# Installing AFEM
Be sure to activate the designed AFEM environment before installation.

AFEM is a pure Python package and can be installed using the command:

    python setup.py develop

within the AFEM root folder. The ``develop`` option links to the source code
at runtime so changes in the source are reflected in any programs using AFEM.
The regular installation command:

    python setup.py install
    
can be used to actually install the AFEM package into the Python site-packages
directory.

Installation files can be cleaned by:

    conda clean -a

# Building Documentation
The documentation can be built from sources using sphinx. Install sphinx and
sphinx_rtd_theme in the desired conda environment by:

    conda install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
    
Then navigate to the *docs/* folder and run:

    make html

This should build html documentation in a *docs/build/html* folder. Open the 
index.html file with a web browser.

# Getting Started
The best way to get started is to examine and run the files in the *examples/*
folder. Running the script:

    python structure_wingbox.py
    
should generate an image similar to the one shown below. Remember to make sure
the appropriate environment is active when using AFEM is applicable.

# TODO
AFEM is under active development and should be considered a work in progress.
The focus is currently:

* Adding (and completing) examples
* Simplifying the rules for meshing parts
* Moving doctests to unit tests and adding more test
